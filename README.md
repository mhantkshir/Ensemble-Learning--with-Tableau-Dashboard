# Ensemble-Learning-Project

1. Introduction
2. 
Stacked generalization is a method for combining estimators to reduce their biases.

It harnesses the capabilities of a range of well-performing models on a classification or regression task.


The predictions of each individual estimator are stacked together and used as input to a final estimator to compute the prediction.

The benifit of stacking is that they have better performance than any single model in the ensemble.

Problem Statement

The US Adult Census dataset is a repository of 48,842 entries extracted from the US Census database.

We aim to predict whether an individualâ€™s income will be greater than $50,000 per year based on several attributes from the census data.

I will be using different ensable learning techniques to check different model accuracy

- From the above distributionplot we can see that Mean & Median age is nearest to 40.
- Age column is skewed to right. Having many customer's age in range of 70-90
- For better understanding we will bin the age column in 3 bins **Young**,**Middle_Age** & **Old_Age**

**Model Perfromance**

**Conclusion** 

- So far best accuracy achieved by Catboost with Train score 0.8808 And Test score 0.8683
- Stacking results are nearest to our best model
